    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These strawberry rhubarb drop biscuits are sweet with a scone-like texture â€” perfect for brunch.</p>
    <p>The technique is quick and easy and results in tender, moist, and delightfully fruity biscuits.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruit Mixture</li>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Egg Wash (optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon Icing Drizzle (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through.</li>
        <li>Grate frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4 cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit is coated with flour.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.</li>
        <li>Scoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.</li>
    </ol>
